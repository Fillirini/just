## Just Simple (justs)

**Just Simple** is a lightweight, rather even stripped-down version of the **Just** language.

This version parses files ONLY in **utf8 encoding**, builds an `AST tree` and interprets it, without generating bytecode. However, you can still use `dynamic library`/`shared object` to call C-compatible functions.
